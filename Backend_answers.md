1. Suppose you're working with 3 people on a project. What would be **the** ideal software development process?

To develop a team project, the ideal process is an agile methodology, such as Scrum, Extreme Programming(XP), Kanban or others. The cyclical development process and team interaction will make it easier for developers to work on different features or different parts of a feature at the same time and support each other when needed.
<p>Based on agile manifesto and its principles, developers must work together daily and talk face-to-face, the team should reflect on how the process is working and what needs to be adjusted at regular intervals, so that with these and other practices, agile processes guarantee greater productivity and customer satisfaction.

2. How do you think an entity relationship diagram for _Instagram_ would be like?

The diagram above was designed using [Lucidchart](http://lucidchart.com/) and the original document can be found [here](https://lucid.app/documents/view/220ba433-6904-49f6-a50a-ad59814dd3bb).

3. Now that you have imagined the ER diagram, **how** would you build _Instagram_ from scratch?
